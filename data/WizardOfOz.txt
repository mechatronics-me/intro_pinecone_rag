### The History of Apple Inc.

**Founding and Early Years (1976–1980)**  
Apple Inc. was founded on April 1, 1976, by **Steve Jobs**, **Steve Wozniak**, and **Ronald Wayne** in Cupertino, California. The trio aimed to develop and sell personal computers. Their first product, the **Apple I**, was a single-board computer designed by Wozniak. Priced at $666.66, it was sold without a monitor, keyboard, or casing.

In 1977, Apple was incorporated, and Wayne sold his shares. The release of the **Apple II** later that year became a turning point. It was one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers, featuring color graphics and an open architecture. By 1980, Apple had grown exponentially and launched its **initial public offering (IPO)**, making several employees instant millionaires.

**The Macintosh Era (1981–1989)**  
In 1983, Apple hired **John Sculley** from PepsiCo as CEO, with the famous pitch from Jobs: "Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life, or do you want to come with me and change the world?"

Apple launched the **Macintosh** in 1984 with an iconic Super Bowl ad directed by Ridley Scott. The Mac introduced the graphical user interface (GUI) to a broader audience, making computers more accessible. Despite its innovation, the high price and limited software led to modest sales.

Tensions between Jobs and Sculley culminated in Jobs leaving Apple in 1985. He went on to found **NeXT Inc.** and acquired **Pixar**, while Apple struggled with its identity.

**Challenges and Innovation (1990–1996)**  
During the early 1990s, Apple introduced several products, including the **PowerBook** (a precursor to modern laptops) and the **Newton** (an early PDA). However, competition from Microsoft and internal missteps, like the costly and delayed **Copland OS**, hurt the company.

By the mid-1990s, Apple faced declining market share and financial losses. Leadership changes and unsuccessful product launches left the company in turmoil.

**The Return of Steve Jobs (1997–2011)**  
In 1997, Apple acquired NeXT for $429 million, bringing Jobs back as an advisor and later interim CEO. Jobs quickly restructured Apple, focusing on simplicity and innovation. He ended licensing agreements for third-party Mac clones, simplified the product line, and introduced the **Think Different** campaign.

Apple launched the **iMac** in 1998, a colorful, all-in-one desktop that revitalized its image and finances. This was followed by groundbreaking innovations:  
- **iPod (2001):** Revolutionized music consumption with iTunes integration.  
- **iTunes Store (2003):** Changed the music industry by offering legal digital downloads.  
- **iPhone (2007):** Redefined smartphones, combining communication, entertainment, and productivity in one device.  
- **App Store (2008):** Created a thriving ecosystem for developers and users.

Jobs' focus on design, user experience, and vertical integration set Apple apart, making it a leader in technology and innovation.

**Expansion and the Post-Jobs Era (2011–2020)**  
Steve Jobs passed away in 2011, shortly after resigning as CEO, leaving Tim Cook to lead Apple. Cook focused on supply chain efficiency, market expansion, and services.

Major product releases included:  
- **iPad (2010):** Popularized tablet computing.  
- **Apple Watch (2015):** Entered the wearable market.  
- **AirPods (2016):** Defined wireless audio.
